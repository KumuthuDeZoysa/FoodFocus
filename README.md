# FoodFocus
FoodFocus is a device that can track and analyse the consumption of sugar, salt and cooking oil of individuals or a group of people.

It was built for the EN1190: Engineering Design Project module in the Semester 2 curriculum of the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa.

After a public survey, it was identified that even though most of the people are aware that the over-consumption of sugar, salt and cooking oil leads to health risks, they lack ways to measure their consumption rigorously. As a result, our team worked for about five months implementing a solution and FoodFocus is the ultimate product.

The device mainly uses loadcells to measure weights of the compartments and the consumption is calculated after a sophisticated manipulation of the loadcell data. The device keeps track on the daily consumption of sugar, salt and cooking oil and indicates if the limit for a particular day is reached. It also provides detailed reports on the overall trend in consumption since the device is first powered on. Additionally, the device also works as a clock and can be used to set alarms to get notified when a food is cooked for the required amount of time.

Coding was initially done using Wokwi platform and then the Arduino IDE using C++ language. PCB was designed using Altium Designer while the enclosure was designed using SOLIDWORKS. 

All the codes, PCB design files, gerber files, enclosure design files and other information regarding the project are available here.
